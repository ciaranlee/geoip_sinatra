This is a Sinatra app that provides geoip information as a web service. It is not the first of it's kind, https://github.com/topfunky/sinatra-geoip is a predecessor and this app does pretty much the same thing.

This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com/. The MaxMind GeoLite data is bundled, which is allowed under the redistribution terms here: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
